# About

My typedoc plugins some are really useful, others just learning / research projects. This is a mono-repo with several projects. A list in order of "importance": 


###(https://github.com/cancerberoSgx/typedoc-plugins-of-mine/tree/master/plugins/typedoc-plugin-as-member-of)[typedoc-plugin-as-member]

Move a declaration so it appear as a member of an existin class or interface. Particularly useful to define events as separarte function declarations without contaminating your classes & interfaces. 

###(https://github.com/cancerberoSgx/typedoc-plugins-of-mine/tree/master/plugins/typedoc-plugin-with-name)[typedoc-plugin-with-name]

Customize the name of any entity. Sometimes we just need to use an alias and not the real name that a member as in the code, you know?
